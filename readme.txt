Reorder WordPress posts with drag & drop mechanism.

== Description ==

You can use the Custom Reorder Manager ( CRO ) plugin to take full control of your WordPress post's sort order.

**Add reorder on demand.** Our CRO settings allow you to add Re-order sub menu under WP custom/default post-types with just a click of the button!

**Add them any type.** Reorder manager can be added to all public post-types such as post, page, media and custom post-types!

**Add them any taxonomy.** Reorder manager can be added to all taxonomies such as categories, tags and custom taxonomies!

**Show them everywhere.** Load and display your posts in CRO order using any theme template file with our hassle free and developer friendly functions!

**Made for developers.** Use functions like: cro_posts(string post_type, array $args = null) and cro_posts_by_taxonomy(array $cro_params, array $args = null) to build powerful templates fast.
